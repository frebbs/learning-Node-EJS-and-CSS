# Purpose of this repo
This repo contains my current working folder I am using to learn how to integrate postgres for persistent storage, 
node for the server back end, authentication to use additional modules and gain an understanding of how this works in practice.

I am also using this as an opportunity to understand the concepts around how CSS works and integrating JavaScript for interactivity

The technologies I am using are:

* Node JS
* NPM (Nodes Package Manager)
* SCSS
* ExpressJS
* EJS for displaying content, its a language that allows you to embed Javascript directly in to HTML pages allowing for dynamic content
* Postgres for persistent data storage
    * For this I will use the PG Module
   

### Node JS, NPM, ExpressJS and EJS

Using node JS for the webserver makes sense as I am already learning JavaScript and Node JS is a JavaScript runtime
environment based on Google's V8 JavaScript Engine. As I will also be relying on other external modules for this, I will
also be using NPM to install JS packages rather then write them from scratch.

Express JS is a framework for setting up the web server, while node has the inbuilt functions to write these from scratch
it does not make sense to do this as Express provides all the conveniences we need and writing them up would not
serve any learning purpose.

If however, its the first time using node and you dont have an understanding of how HTTP and node work together, then doing this at
least once would be recommended to at least get an understanding of what happens behind the scenes.

### Postgres

No particular reason for this, any SQL server would do, even a noSQL database like MongoDB will be just fine.
